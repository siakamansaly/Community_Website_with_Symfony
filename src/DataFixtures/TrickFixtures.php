Frontside rodeo can be done off the heels or toes and with a little more spin on the horizontal axis can go to 720 or 900. The bigger the horizontal spin, the later the inverted part of the rotation should be. Gaining control on big spin rodeos may lead to a double cork or a second flip rotation in the spin, if the rider has developed a comfort level with double flips on a trampoline or other gymnastic environment.;Rodeo flip; frontside rodeo: A frontward-flipping frontside spin done off the toe edge. Most commonly performed with a 540° rotation, but also performed as a 720°, 900°, etc..',
